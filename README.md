# aoc-2021
Advent of Code 2021 repo

## Getting Started
My code can be run by installing requirements and running any script in `src` 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python src/day{n}.py`

## Tools
I use `black` and `flake8` at minimum. `black` runs automatically but I have `flake8` configured in the repo

I am trying to minimize duplicated code as well by using [jscpd](https://github.com/kucherenko/jscpd)
